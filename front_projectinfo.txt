<h1>I'm a 30 year old Black-American Street Photographer and Videographer, Author, Internet Culture Folklore Researcher and Archivist, Political Analyst and Blogger, and Internet Broadcaster and Newsreader. I have 7 years experience of Linux Systems Administration, with 3 years of Quality Assurance for Windows Laptops and Desktops. Since 2014 I was forced to the sole provider support my unemployed parents with my meager income since they got laid off due to rampant age discrimination.&nbsp;<br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">It happened during a time when I was finally planning to move out of my parents. My original plan was to rent a room, get IT certifications, build a 5,000 dollar savings fund. Build a few side projects: Creating a political book, start creating a photography portfolio from all the photography I did over the past 7 years, maybe create a political podcast. By then I would have started paying off my student loan debt. When my parents lost their jobs I had to support them because government programs were either non-existent or inaccessible.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">I tried getting them help anyway: Section 8 and Housing Assistance But Section 8 in our area is permanently waitlisted and closed and Housing Assistance grants in our area were never funded for the past three years the last time I inquired. As a result I have to pay the rent, utilities, and food with my merger income while sacrificing my future and dreams of moving out, gaining certifications, or developing savings. My parents ran out of unemployment on April 2015, and they’re not eligible for social security because they’re not 62.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">Private charity &nbsp;and churches I sought out either require paperwork for minimal help or told us straight up that they don’t have the funding or can’t help me without saying why. In some cases they talked to me and had a conversation with one church organization that would help find a job with my resume and I’ve never got a call back for a update and he ignored subsequent follow-up phone calls from my end.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">Despite my parents best efforts to seek work and their experience and skill sets in in Business management, Event/Logistics Management, Contract/Acquisition Management, and Human Resources, contract administration, business management, recruitment, data research, planning and coordinating. They have never gotten a call back from an employer. Not even Wal-Mart or McDonalds would hire them, nor even dollar stores would hire them because they want younger workers.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">The only employers that wanted to hire her were temp agencies that shove them into a warehouse position which caused them to have pain with their legs and she discovered to have osteoporosis.&nbsp;</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">The effects on my life are severe. We had to leave our apartment because we could not afford it and have to move to a rented house. We acculated 5,000 dollars of past due rent as a result until they found a renter. I had student loans that I could not pay for the past four years: 26,000 dollars. In addition I have to use my credit cards to pay for the moving costs that’s a debt of at least 10,000 dollars I was planning to pay off. Before I was laid off from my IT job in October 2017 I have spent at least 54,000 dollars to support my parents, at least 30,000 dollars would have been put into savings to pay off my student loans.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">And for the past 3 years I’ve been past due with all utilities because of the lack of money. Because of all of this, plus the unpaid rent from the apartment that I had to leave my credit rating is in poor shape.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">I had to sacrifice my health, as in to skip own doctors appointments and my dental health and had to forgo teeth fillings I had planned to continue in 2014. My mental health has also faltered as my emotional and physical energy has been drained so much that it takes me a month to even write a paper or to respond to a email or hours to prepare to play a video game or read a book. It has affected my speaking as I stutter and constantly mispronounce and skip words adjectives and verbs a lot more often, my writing, and left me mistyping words a lot because my hands shake uncontrollably from time to time.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">Despite my best attempts of job seeking, I’ve applied for 3,000 jobs and the most part I have received no call backs. Recruiters often ask for my resume or come to their offices for an initial discussion or meeting, only to end up with nothing or can’t help weeks later. Government programs, two that I’m in, have been slow going despite following all the requirements and pre-classes and meetings and still can’t find any openings they can fill me in. I’m also rejected from services form the state’s department of disabilities despite having applied for disability services of another department and having a psychological report submitted to them.&nbsp;</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">Despite having a network of family, co-workers I worked with and friends they are either unable to help me, they’re in the same boat, or have not able to return my phone calls or messages.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">The only job leads that are pending are in the US government for a IT Specialist which it’s status has not been updated since last year, and for a state government position for child support specialist has only updated it’s status last month and it will take another six months in order for me to start working.</span><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">And for anyone who is asking, we don’t have the money or resources to move to a low-cost of living state. And due to the fact that I have a developmental disability, and scoliosis my career and job options are limited.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"></h1><h1><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">My initial goal is at least $10,000. More than enough to rent a room, get a A+ and Linux+ Cert, and move to a better job market. I live in the DC area and despite the booming job market you are required to have a Active Secret Clearance for most jobs and you are basically required to know someone that is willing and able to help.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">My ultimate goal is to reach at least $100,000. More than enough to pay off all my credit card, student loan, and past due rent that has accumulated for the past 3 years so I can have a fresh start and concentrate on my dreams of publishing a book.</span><br style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;"></h1><h1><span style="font-family: Lato, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;">In addition I will provide you with proof of my need via dropbox for anyone who inquires, and when I receive the money to pay off the bills, student loans, past due rent, and credit cards I will show proof that they are paid via twitter/instagram so that you can be assured that the money will not be squandered or wasted.</span></h1>
